# Product Guidelines: AuraDash (Angular Edition)

## Content and Prose Style
- **Technical Precision:** Use industry-standard terminology for automation and software engineering (e.g., "idempotency," "Shadow DOM," "RBAC").
- **Instructional Focus:** Frame documentation and UI labels to guide users through testing challenges, offering clear explanations of *why* certain features exist for testing.
- **Tone:** Professional yet encouraging, positioning the application as a "testing crucible" for mastery.

## Visual and UI Design
- **Modern Dashboard Aesthetic:** Leverage Tailwind CSS to create a clean, professional-grade interface that mimics real-world enterprise applications.
- **Professional Polish:** Prioritize a high-quality visual experience to make the testing environment feel realistic and engaging.

## Interaction Design
- **Stateful Feedback:** Provide explicit visual cues for all interactive states (hover, focus, active, loading) to assist both manual testers and automation scripts in verifying element status.
- **Predictable Behavior:** Ensure that UI transitions and animations are consistent and can be reliably synchronized with automation tools.
