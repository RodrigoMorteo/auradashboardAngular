# Initial Concept
AuraDash (Angular Edition) is a modern System Under Test (SUT) meticulously designed to validate the capabilities of contemporary test automation frameworks.

# Product Guide: AuraDash (Angular Edition)

## Target Audience
- **QA Engineers:** Individuals seeking a realistic and challenging environment to practice and refine their automation skills.
- **SDETs:** Engineers evaluating the robustness and capabilities of new testing tools and libraries.
- **Framework Developers:** Teams benchmarking their automation tools against complex UI patterns.
- **QA Consultants:** Professionals demonstrating test automation best practices and framework capabilities to clients.

## Core Goals
- **UI Complexity Benchmark:** Provide a rich, complex UI surface including Shadow DOM, interactive SVGs, and dynamic elements to test the limits of automation framework resilience.
- **Testability Advocacy:** Demonstrate how to build highly testable applications using programmatic state control and predictable behaviors.

## Key Features
- **Advanced UI Patterns:** Real-time interactive SVG charts, data visualizations, and infinite scrolling lists.
- **Shadow DOM Integration:** Web components built with Lit to challenge framework selector strategies and event handling.
- **Programmatic State Management:** A dedicated API for resetting and setting application state, ensuring idempotent and non-flaky test runs.
- **Interactive Elements:** Drag-and-drop interfaces to test complex user interactions.
- **Form Interaction Challenges:** Complex form controls including radio buttons, checkboxes, and state persistence to validate form handling and verification strategies.
- **RBAC Simulation:** Built-in Role-Based Access Control scenarios to demonstrate how tests can adapt to different user permission levels.
